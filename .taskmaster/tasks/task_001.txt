# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Dependency Installation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Node.js project, create the standard folder structure for the MCP server, and install the required npm packages: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `zod`.
# Details:
Create a `package.json` file, run `npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod`. Set up the initial `main.js` entry file and the `/sections` directory.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that `npm install` completes without errors and that the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` are created. Check that the initial project structure matches the PRD.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Node.js Project [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the `package.json` file to define the project, its metadata, and manage its dependencies.
### Details:
Run the command `npm init -y` in the root directory of the project to generate a default `package.json` file.

## 2. Install Required NPM Packages [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install the core dependencies required for the MCP server: the SDK and the Zod validation library.
### Details:
Execute the command `npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod` in the terminal from the project root.

## 3. Create Initial Directory Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the basic folder structure for the project, specifically the directory intended to hold the reusable page sections.
### Details:
Create a new directory named `sections` in the root of the project. This folder will house the component libraries.

## 4. Create Application Entry File [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the initial JavaScript file that will serve as the main entry point for the Node.js application.
### Details:
Create a new, empty file named `main.js` in the project's root directory.

## 5. Configure `package.json` Start Script [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.4
### Description: Add a convenient `start` script to the `package.json` file to make running the server straightforward.
### Details:
Modify the `scripts` object within the `package.json` file to add a `start` key with the value `"node main.js"`.
