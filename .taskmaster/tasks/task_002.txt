# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement MCP Server Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the `main.js` entry file to instantiate and configure the core MCP server. This includes setting up the server instance and connecting the required transports.
# Details:
In `main.js`, import `McpServer` and `StdioServerTransport`. Instantiate the server with the name 'landing-page-server'. Implement the async main function to connect the stdio transport as per the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Run `node main.js`. The server should start without errors and listen for commands via stdio. No tools will be available yet.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create `main.js` Entry File [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the primary entry file `main.js` for the MCP server application in the project's root directory.
### Details:
The file should be created in the project's root directory. It will serve as the starting point for the server's execution and will contain all subsequent logic for this task.

## 2. Import Core MCP Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Add the necessary import statements for `McpServer` and `StdioServerTransport` at the top of `main.js`.
### Details:
Use ES module `import` syntax to bring the `McpServer` and `StdioServerTransport` classes into the `main.js` scope from their respective library paths.

## 3. Instantiate McpServer [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create an instance of the `McpServer` class with the specified server name 'landing-page-server'.
### Details:
In `main.js`, after the import statements, instantiate `McpServer` by calling its constructor with the name 'landing-page-server'. Assign the resulting object to a constant named `server`.

## 4. Implement Async Main Execution Function [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Define and call an asynchronous `main` function to encapsulate the server's startup logic.
### Details:
Create an `async function main() { ... }`. This function will contain the logic for connecting transports. Add a call to `main()` at the end of the script to ensure it runs when the file is executed.

## 5. Connect StdioServerTransport [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Instantiate and connect the `StdioServerTransport` to the MCP server instance within the main function.
### Details:
Inside the `main` function, create a new instance of `StdioServerTransport`. Then, call the `await server.connect()` method, passing the transport instance to it. This enables the server to listen for commands via standard I/O.
