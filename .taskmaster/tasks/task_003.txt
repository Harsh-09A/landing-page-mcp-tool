# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create and Populate Landing Page Sections Repository
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish the centralized library of reusable section designs by creating the folder structure and populating it with sample HTML, CSS, and JS files for various landing page sections.
# Details:
Create subdirectories inside `/sections` for `header`, `hero`, `gallery`, etc. Within each, create at least two design variations (e.g., `hero-1`, `hero-2`) containing `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files as specified in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Manually inspect the `/sections` directory to ensure it matches the structure defined in the PRD. Validate that the sample HTML/CSS/JS files are well-formed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Section Category Directories [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the top-level folder structure for different types of landing page sections within the main `/sections` directory as outlined in the PRD.
### Details:
Inside the `/sections` directory, create the following subdirectories: `header`, `hero`, `gallery`, `features`, and `footer`. This structure will house the different design variations for each section type.

## 2. Populate Header Section Variations [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create two distinct design variations for the `header` section, including their HTML structure, CSS styling, and any associated JavaScript.
### Details:
Inside `/sections/header`, create two subdirectories: `header-1` and `header-2`. In each, create `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. The HTML should contain a logo placeholder and basic navigation links. The CSS should provide distinct styling for each variation (e.g., `header-1` with a solid background, `header-2` transparent and sticky).

## 3. Populate Hero Section Variations [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create two distinct design variations for the `hero` section, providing sample content for a compelling page introduction.
### Details:
Inside `/sections/hero`, create two subdirectories: `hero-1` and `hero-2`. In each, create `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. The HTML should include a main headline, a subheadline, and a call-to-action button. The CSS should provide distinct layouts (e.g., `hero-1` with a background image, `hero-2` with a two-column layout).

## 4. Populate Gallery Section Variations [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create two distinct design variations for a `gallery` section to showcase images or projects.
### Details:
Inside `/sections/gallery`, create two subdirectories: `gallery-1` and `gallery-2`. In each, create `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. The HTML should contain a grid of placeholder images. The CSS should style the grid differently for each variation (e.g., a standard 3-column grid vs. a masonry layout).

## 5. Populate Features Section Variations [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create two distinct design variations for a `features` section, designed to highlight key product benefits or services.
### Details:
Inside `/sections/features`, create two subdirectories: `features-1` and `features-2`. In each, create `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. The HTML should contain a set of feature blocks, each with an icon placeholder, a title, and a description. The CSS should provide different layouts (e.g., a 3-column layout vs. alternating left/right image-text blocks).
